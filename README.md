## Twitter Totals

Simple Ruby on Rails app built to integrate with the Twitter API.

A user can enter a twitter handle, and information about their tweet frequency is displayed (exact tbc). This might include:

* Tweets by date
* Tweet vs. Retweet ratio*

All dependent on the Twitter API functionality

### Tools

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* RSpec
* Capybara

Note on [Twitter-Rails gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter): In the first instance I'm going to start by not using this, in order to ensure I understand the structure of the Twitter API.

### To Use

`$ bin/rake db:create`


### Aims

* Skinny models
