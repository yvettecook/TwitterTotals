## Twitter Totals

*Note: In progress*

Simple Ruby on Rails app built to integrate with the Twitter API.

A user can enter a twitter handle, and their 'narcissism score'* is calculated

Narcissim score is calcuated by comparing the ratio of the user's tweets to the number of retweets. Hardly scientific, and surprisingly tricky to tease out of the Twitter API.
